A fitness tracker app is a mobile application that helps users monitor and manage their physical activity and overall health. It typically works in conjunction with a wearable fitness tracker (like a smartwatch or wristband) or uses smartphone sensors to collect data on steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, sleep patterns, heart rate, and more. The app then analyzes and visualizes this data, often offering personalized insights, goal setting, and motivational tools to help users stay active and improve their fitness.
